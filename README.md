# Project 1 - *SimpleToDo*

**SimpleToDo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management 
functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Borislav Sabotinov**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** 
  and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list
  Note: I used the new `registerForActivityResult` method, as the method in the guide using 
  `startActivityForResult` is now deprecated. 

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Changed background, learned that file-based resource names must follow a convention
* [x] Changed color of Android mascot and drew a Shrek ear
* [x] Created NiceButton and GrayButton based on guide
* [x] Used Unicode (HTML encoded) to display icons for adding a task and saving a change
* [x] Added log statement when an item is deleted
* [x] Placed labels for buttons and other UI items under `res/values/strings.xml`
